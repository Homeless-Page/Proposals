# Proposals
Simple repository to start tracking to proposals, voting before voting, etc

# Charities
Just raise an issue with the charity name for your country, with a signed message with your donation. Charities this time round should be well known charities, all funds will be distributed equally across all of them, so we should aim to have the same number of charities per country.

# Multisig requests / maintainer
Just raise an issue and we can have a chat, only verified humans please.

# Collaboration, ideas.
Just raise an issue !!
